# ANN-Model-For-Housing-Price
This project focuses on building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict housing prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, square footage, location, and other property attributes. The goal is to design a regression model that learns complex relationships between input features and house prices, providing accurate price estimations for unseen data.

The workflow begins with data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The processed data is then fed into a feedforward ANN consisting of input, hidden, and output layers. The model uses backpropagation and optimization algorithms (such as Adam optimizer) to minimize prediction error by adjusting network weights over multiple epochs.

Implemented in Python with TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, and Pandas, the project also employs Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and performance analysis. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score are used to assess model accuracy.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of ANN in solving regression problems and can be applied to real estate price prediction, property valuation, and market trend analysis. It also provides a foundation for exploring more advanced architectures and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
